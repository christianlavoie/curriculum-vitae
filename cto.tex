\begin{description}%
\item[Hiring] Scaled a team of 7 developers to 21 developers across 4 teams in less than 12 months; mentored data analysts through multiple promotions. Emphasis on diversity allowed me to go from no female representation to about 20\% within the same timeframe.
\item[Productivity] Put in place processes to reduce technical debt and fundamental design problems within the mobile application and its backend.
\item[Technical Excellence] Managed the team through a database migration (MySQL to PostgreSQL) with no externally perceived downtime.

\cventry{2016-2017}{VP Technology}{\Large Acquisio}{Montr\'{e}al, Canada}{}{}
\begin{description}%
\item[Culture] Brought in to change the culture and attitude of a demoralized group of more than 50 developers. Made engineering the only department with no turnover despite high turnover before and, in other departments, during my tenure.
\item[Productivity] Restructured 3 classic teams (frontend, backend, QA) into 8 autonomous agile teams (1 TL, 1-2 QA, 5-6 devs, 1 PM) to manage development; significantly increased the teams' productivity, in some cases by nearly 50\% more deliverables per quarter.
\item[Technical Excellence] Personally rolled out the Prometheus monitoring system both as a response to the one downtime under my tenure and to serve as an example ``from the trenches'' to my staff.
