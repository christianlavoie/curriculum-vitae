\item[Culture] Brought in to change the culture and attitude of a demoralized group of more than 50 developers. Made engineering the only department with no turnover despite high turnover before, after and, in other departments, during my tenure.
\item[Productivity] Restructured 3 classic teams (frontend, backend, QA) into 8 autonomous agile teams (1 TL, 1-2 QA, 5-6 devs, 1 PM) to manage development; significantly increased the teams' productivity, in some cases by nearly 50\% more deliverables per quarter.
\item[Technical Excellence] Personally rolled out the Prometheus monitoring system both as a response to the one downtime under my tenure and to serve as an example ``from the trenches'' to my staff.
